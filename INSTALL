TarotClub install
------------------

* Windows

Use the Setup executable. Shortcut is in the start menu.

* Ubuntu
=========

Two packages are available depending of your architecture, i386 (32-bits) or x86_64 (64-bits). If your using a command line installation, you will have to execute two commands to resolve dependencies:

dpkg -i tarotclub-2.1.0-alpha.1_amd64.deb
apt-get -f install

== Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 ==

You have to add the PPA Qt5-Proper source to your package source list to get the Qt5 libraries needed by TarotClub.
https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers/+archive/qt5-proper

== Ubuntu 13.04 ==

The Qt5 libraries are available in standard with this version of Ubuntu, just install the .deb package as usual.

* Generic Linux
===============

Decompress the .tar.bzip2 archive where you want in your system. You'll probably have to install 
suitable Qt libraries (Qt5.0).

Run the install script "install.sh" located at the TarotClub root directory. This script will add a new character font in your system.

* Mac
=======

There is no ready-to-use executable available yet. Compile TarotClub from the source code.

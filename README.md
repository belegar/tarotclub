# TarotClub, the free French Tarot card game!

## Introduction

TarotClub is a Tarot card game (not the divination one) playable on any computer 
with Mac OS X, Windows or Linux.
The Tarot card game is mostly played in french-spoken countries. It uses a specific 
deck of cards including standard card figures plus the Knight and 22 trumps. The complete 
rules of the Tarot card game is available in Wikipedia.

This project is a tentative to create a nice open source version of this game, playable in 
various operating system and with a modular design.
